# High performance

ApsaraDB RDS uses high-end hardware to provide high-performance database instances. These database instances bring benefits such as parameter optimization, SQL optimization, and high-speed access.

## Parameter optimization

The top database experts at Alibaba Cloud have optimized RDS parameters based on many years of experience in production. Database administrators \(DBAs\) continuously optimize ApsaraDB RDS throughout its lifecycle to ensure that ApsaraDB RDS instances are running with optimal performance.

## SQL optimization

ApsaraDB RDS locks low-efficiency SQL statements and provides recommendations to help you optimize your business code based on your application scenario.

## High-end hardware

All servers that are used by ApsaraDB RDS have been evaluated by a number of parties to ensure optimal performance and stability.

## High-speed access

If an RDS instance is used with an Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instance that resides in the same region, these instances can communicate over an internal network. This shortens response time and reduces Internet traffic consumption. For more information about ECS instances, see [What is ECS?](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/What is ECS?.md)
