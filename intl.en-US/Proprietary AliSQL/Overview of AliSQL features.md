# Overview of AliSQL features

This topic provides an overview of the features that are provided by AliSQL. This topic also provides a comparison between AliSQL and other MySQL versions.

## Introduction to AliSQL

AliSQL is an independent MySQL branch that is developed by Alibaba Cloud. AliSQL provides all of the features that are available in the MySQL Community edition. AliSQL also provides some similar features that you can find in the MySQL Enterprise edition. These similar features include enterprise-grade backup and restoration, thread pool, and parallel query. In addition, AliSQL provides Oracle-compatible features, such as the Sequence engine. ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL with AliSQL provides all the basic features of MySQL and a wide range of advanced features. These advanced features include enterprise-grade security, backup and restoration, monitoring, performance optimization, and read-only instance.

## Features and supported MySQL versions

|Category|Feature|Description|MySQL 8.0|MySQL 5.7|MySQL 5.6|
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
|Functionality|[Thread Pool](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Feature/Thread Pool.md)|The thread pool feature separates threads from sessions. If a large number of sessions are created on your RDS instance, ApsaraDB RDS can run a small number of threads to complete the tasks in active sessions.|Supported|Supported|Supported|
|[Statement outline](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Feature/Statement outline.md)|The statement outline feature allows you to stably run query plans by using optimizer and index hints. You can install the DBMS\_OUTLN package to use this feature.|Supported|Supported|Not supported|
|[Sequence Engine](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Feature/Sequence Engine.md)|The Sequence engine simplifies the generation of sequence values on your RDS instance.|Supported|Not supported|Supported|
|[Returning](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Feature/Returning.md)|This returning feature allows data manipulation language \(DML\) statements to return result sets. You can install the DBMS\_TRANS package to use this feature.|Supported|Not supported|Not supported|
|Performance|[A new version is available.](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Performance/Fast query cache.md)|The fast query cache is a query cache that is developed by Alibaba Cloud based on the native MySQL query cache. The fast query cache uses a new design and a new implementation mechanism to increase the query performance of your RDS instance.|Not supported|Supported|Not supported|
|[Binlog in Redo](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Performance/Binlog in Redo.md)|The Binlog in Redo feature synchronously writes binary logs to the redo log file when a transaction is committed. This reduces the operations on the disk and improves the performance of your RDS instance.|Supported|Not supported|Not supported|
|[Statement Queue](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Performance/Statement Queue.md)|The statement queue feature allows statements to queue in the same bucket. These statements may be executed on the same resources. For example, these statements are executed on the same row of a table. This feature reduces overheads from possible conflicts.|Supported|Supported|Not supported|
|[Inventory Hint](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Performance/Inventory Hint.md)|The inventory hint feature can work with the returning and statement queue features to rapidly commit and roll back transactions. This increases the throughput of your application.|Supported|Supported|Supported|
|Stability|[Faster DDL](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Stability/Faster DDL.md)|The faster DDL feature provides an optimized buffer pool management mechanism. This mechanism reduces the impact of data definition language \(DDL\) operations on the performance of your RDS instance. This mechanism also increases the number of concurrent DDL operations that are allowed.|Supported|Supported|Supported|
|[Statement concurrency control](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Stability/Statement concurrency control.md)|The concurrency control \(CCL\) feature allows ApsaraDB RDS to control the concurrency of statements based on syntax rules. You can install the DBMS\_CCL package to use this feature.|Supported|Supported|Not supported|
|[Performance Agent](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Stability/Performance Agent.md)|The performance agent feature is provided as a plug-in of MySQL. You can use this feature to calculate and analyze the performance metrics of your RDS instance.|Supported|Supported|Supported|
|[Purge Large File Asynchronously](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Stability/Purge Large File Asynchronously.md)|The Purge Large File Asynchronously feature allows ApsaraDB RDS to asynchronously delete files from your RDS instance. This ensures the stability of your RDS instance.|Supported|Supported|Supported|
|[Performance Insight](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Stability/Performance Insight.md)|The performance insight feature supports load monitoring, association analysis, and performance optimization at the instance level. You can evaluate loads on your RDS instance and resolve performance issues. This allows you to improve the stability of your RDS instance.|Supported|Supported|Not supported|
|Security|[Data Protect](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Security/Data Protect.md)|The data protection feature controls the permissions on delete operations. This allows you to protect your data from being accidentally deleted.|Supported|Supported|Supported|
|[Recycle bin](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Security/Recycle bin.md)|The recycle bin feature allows ApsaraDB RDS to temporarily store deleted tables. It also allows you to specify a retention period within which you can retrieve the deleted tables. You can install the DBMS\_RECYCLE package to use this feature.|Supported|Not supported|Not supported|
