|20191015|-   New features:
    -   The TDE feature is introduced to support real-time I/O encryption and decryption on data files. It encrypts data before it is written to the disk and decrypts data before it is read from the disk to the memory. For more information, see [Configure TDE for an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Data security/Configure TDE for an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance.md).
    -   The returning feature is introduced. It allows data manipulation language \(DML\) statements to return result sets. In addition, the DBMS\_TRANS package is provided for you to use this feature. For more information, see [Returning](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Feature/Returning.md).
    -   The forced conversion from the MyISAM or MEMORY storage engine to the InnoDB storage engine is supported. If the global variable **force\_mysiam\_to\_innodb** or **force\_memory\_to\_innodb** is set to **ON**, a table is converted from the MyISAM or MEMORY storage engine to the InnoDB storage engine when the table is created or modified.
    -   A mechanism is introduced to forbid standard accounts from performing primary/secondary switchovers. Only privileged accounts have the permissions to perform primary/secondary switchovers.
    -   A performance proxy plug-in is provided. It obtains performance data and saves the data as TXT files to your computer. These files are deleted in a circular manner. Only the latest files at the single-digit second level are retained.
    -   A configurable timeout period is introduced for mutexes in InnoDB. This timeout period can be changed by setting the global variable **innodb\_fatal\_semaphore\_wait\_threshold**. The default value of the global variable is 600.
    -   Index hint errors can be ignored by setting the global variable **ignore\_index\_hint\_error**. The default value of the global variable is false.
    -   The SSL encryption feature can be disabled. For more information, see [Configure SSL encryption on an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Data security/Configure SSL encryption on an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance.md).
    -   The output of TCP errors is supported. TCP errors in read, read-wait, and write-wait events are returned with their error codes by using end\_connection events. In addition, logs with information about the errors are generated.
-   Bugs fixed:
    -   The bug that prevents a Linux operating system from merging local asynchronous I/O \(AIO\) requests before linear Read Ahead is triggered is fixed.
    -   The bug that prevents the proper collection of table and index statistics is fixed.
    -   The bug that prevents the system direct access to the primary key index of a table with a primary key is fixed. |

For more information, see [Thread Pool](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Feature/Thread Pool.md).
    -   The CCL mechanism is introduced. It allows you to specify the maximum number of concurrent requests that are allowed. This enables the system to handle traffic bursts, process statements that consume excessive resources, and adapt to changes of SQL models. This also ensures the continuity and stability of your database service. For more information, see [Statement concurrency control](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Stability/Statement concurrency control.md).
    -   The statement outline feature is introduced to support optimizer hints and index hints. These hints are used to stabilize the execution of query plans on an RDS instance. For more information, see [Statement outline](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Feature/Statement outline.md).

    -   The Purge Large File Asynchronously feature is introduced to asynchronously delete files. Before you delete a tablespace, the system renames the files in the tablespace as temporary files. Then, the system starts a background thread to asynchronously delete the temporary files. For more information, see [Purge Large File Asynchronously](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Stability/Purge Large File Asynchronously.md).
    -   The performance insight feature is introduced to support load monitoring, association analysis, and performance optimization at the instance level. This feature allows you to evaluate the loads of an RDS instance. This feature also allows you to locate performance issues to ensure the stability of your database service. For more information, see [Performance Insight](/intl.en-US/Proprietary AliSQL/Stability/Performance Insight.md).
    -   An optimized instance locking mechanism is introduced. You can delete tables from an RDS instance by using DROP or TRUNCATE statements even if the RDS instance is locked.
-   Bugs fixed:
    -   The bug that causes the system to incorrectly calculate file sizes is fixed.
    -   The bug that allows irrelevant processes to reuse released memory resources is fixed.
