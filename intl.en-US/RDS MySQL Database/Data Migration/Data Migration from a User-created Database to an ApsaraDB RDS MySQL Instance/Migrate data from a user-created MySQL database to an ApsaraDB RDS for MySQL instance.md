# Migrate data from a user-created MySQL database to an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance

This topic describes how to migrate data from a user-created MySQL database to an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance by using Data Transmission Service \(DTS\). DTS supports schema migration, full data migration, and incremental data migration. When you migrate data from a user-created MySQL database, you can select all of the supported migration types to ensure service continuity.

## Prerequisites

-   An ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance is created. For more information, see [Create an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Quick start/Create an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance.md).
-   The version of the user-created MySQL database is 5.1, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, or 8.0.
-   The available storage space of the destination ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance is larger than the total size of the data in the user-created MySQL database.

## Precautions

-   DTS uses read and write resources of the source and destination databases during full data migration. This may increase the database load. If the database performance is unfavorable, the specification is low, or the data volume is large, database services may become unavailable. For example, DTS occupies a large amount of read and write resources in the following cases: a large number of slow SQL queries are performed on the source database, the tables have no primary keys, or a deadlock occurs in the destination database. Before you migrate data, evaluate the performance of the source and destination databases. We recommend that you migrate data during off-peak hours. For example, you can migrate data when the CPU usage of the source and destination databases is less than 30%.
-   The source database must have PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraints and all fields must be unique. Otherwise, duplicate data may exist in the destination database.
-   DTS uses the `ROUND(COLUMN,PRECISION)` function to retrieve values from columns of the float or double data type. If the precision is not specified, DTS sets the precision for the float data type to 38 digits and the precision for the double data type to 308 digits. You must check whether the precision settings meet your business requirements.
-   DTS automatically creates a destination database in the ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance. However, if the name of the source database is invalid, you must manually create a database in the ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance before you configure the data migration task.

    **Note:** For more information about how to create a database and the database naming conventions, see [Create databases and accounts](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/96105.htm).

-   DTS automatically resumes a failed data migration task. Before you switch your workloads to the destination database, stop or release the data migration task. Otherwise, the data in the source database will overwrite the data in the destination database after the task is resumed.

## Billing

|Migration type|Instance configurations|Internet traffic|
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------|
|Schema migration and full data migration|Free of charge.|Charged only when data is migrated from Alibaba Cloud over the Internet. For more information, see [Pricing]().|
|Incremental data migration|Charged. For more information, see [Pricing]().|

## Migration types

-   Schema migration

    DTS migrates the schemas of the required objects to the destination instance. DTS supports schema migration for the following types of objects: table, view, trigger, stored procedure, and function.

    **Note:**

    -   During schema migration, DTS changes the value of the SECURITY attribute in views, stored procedures, and functions from DEFINER to INVOKER.
    -   DTS does not migrate user information. Before a user can call views, stored procedures, and functions of the destination database, you must grant the read/write permissions to the user.
-   Full data migration

    DTS migrates historical data of the required objects from the user-created MySQL database to the destination database in the ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance.

    **Note:** During full data migration, concurrent INSERT operations cause fragmentation in the tables of the destination instance. After full data migration is complete, the tablespace of the destination instance is larger than that of the source database.

-   Incremental data migration

    After full data migration is complete, DTS retrieves binary log files from the user-created MySQL database. Then, DTS synchronizes incremental data from the user-created MySQL database to the destination ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance. Incremental data migration allows you to ensure service continuity when you migrate data from a user-created MySQL database to Alibaba Cloud.


## SQL operations that can be synchronized during incremental data migration

|Operation type|SQL statements|
|--------------|--------------|
|DML|INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and REPLACE|
|DDL|-   ALTER TABLE and ALTER VIEW
-   CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE INDEX, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE TABLE, and CREATE VIEW
-   DROP INDEX and DROP TABLE
-   RENAME TABLE
-   TRUNCATE TABLE |

## Permissions required for database accounts

    |Section|Parameter|Description|
    |:------|:--------|:----------|
    |N/A|Task Name|DTS automatically generates a task name. We recommend that you specify an informative name for easy identification. You do not need to use a unique task name.|
    |Source Database|Instance Type|Select an instance type based on where the source database is deployed. The procedure in this topic uses **User-Created Database with Public IP Address** as an example. **Note:** If you select other instance types, you must prepare the environments that are required for the source database. For more information, see [Preparation overview](). |
    |Instance Region|If the instance type is set to **User-Created Database with Public IP Address**, you do not need to specify the **instance region**. **Note:** If a whitelist is configured for the user-created MySQL database, you must manually add the CIDR blocks of DTS servers to the whitelist of the user-created MySQL database. You can click **Get IP Address Segment of DTS** next to **Instance Region** to obtain the CIDR blocks of DTS servers. |
    |Database Type|Select **MySQL**.|
    |Hostname or IP Address|Enter the IP address that is used to access the user-created MySQL database. In this example, enter the public IP address.|
    |Port Number|Enter the service port number of the user-created MySQL database. The default port number is **3306**.|
    |Database Account|Enter the account of the user-created MySQL database. For more information about the permissions that are required for the account, see [Permissions required for database accounts](#section_bjn_5zq_5hb).|
    |Database Password|Enter the password for the source database account. **Note:** After you specify the source database parameters, click **Test Connectivity** next to **Database Password** to verify whether the specified parameters are valid. If the specified parameters are valid, the **Passed** message appears. If the **Failed** message appears, click **Check** next to **Failed**. Modify the source database parameters based on the check results. |
    |Destination Database|Instance Type|Select **RDS Instance**.|
    |Instance Region|Select the region where the destination RDS instance resides.|
    |RDS Instance ID|Select the ID of the destination RDS instance.|
    |Database Account|Enter the database account of the destination RDS instance. For more information about the permissions that are required for the account, see [Permissions required for database accounts](#section_bjn_5zq_5hb).|
    |Database Password|Enter the password for the destination database account. **Note:** After you specify the destination database parameters, click **Test Connectivity** next to **Database Password** to verify whether the parameters are valid. If the specified parameters are valid, the **Passed** message appears. If the **Failed** message appears, click **Check** next to **Failed**. Modify the destination database parameters based on the check results. |
    |Encryption|Select **Non-encrypted** or **SSL-encrypted**. If you want to select **SSL-encrypted**, you must enable SSL encryption for the RDS instance before you configure the data migration task. For more information, see [Configure SSL encryption for an RDS for MySQL instance](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/96120.htm). **Note:** The **Encryption** parameter is available only for regions in mainland China and the Hong Kong \(China\) region. |

6.  In the lower-right corner of the page, click **Set Whitelist and Next**.

    **Note:** The CIDR blocks of DTS servers are automatically added to the whitelist of the destination RDS instance. This ensures that DTS servers can connect to the destination RDS instance.

7.  Select the migration types and objects to be migrated.

    ![Select the migration types and objects to be migrated](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9840359951/p47745.png)

    |Parameter|Description|
    |:--------|:----------|
    |Migration Types|    -   To perform only full data migration, select **Schema Migration** and **Full Data Migration**.
    -   To migrate data with minimal downtime, select **Schema Migration**, **Full Data Migration**, and **Incremental Data Migration**.
 **Note:** If **Incremental Data Migration** is not selected, do not write data into the source database during full data migration. This ensures data consistency between the source and destination databases. |
    |Objects|Select objects from the Available section and click the ![Right arrow](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3457359951/p40698.png) icon to move the objects to the Selected section.

 **Note:**

    -   You can select columns, tables, or databases as the objects to be migrated.
    -   After an object is migrated to the destination database, the name of the object remains the same as that in the source database. You can change the names of the objects that are migrated to the destination database by using the object name mapping feature. For more information about how to use this feature, see [Object name mapping]().
    -   If you use the object name mapping feature on an object, other objects that are dependent on the object may fail to be migrated. |

8.  In the lower-right corner of the page, click **Precheck**.

    **Note:**

    -   Before you can start the data migration task, a precheck is performed. You can start the data migration task only after the task passes the precheck.
    -   If the task fails to pass the precheck, click the ![Info icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3457359951/p47468.png) icon next to each failed item to view details. Troubleshoot the issues based on the causes and run the precheck again.
9.  After the task passes the precheck, click **Next**.
10. In the Confirm Settings dialog box, specify the **Channel Specification** and select the **Data Transmission Service \(Pay-As-You-Go\) Service Terms**.
11. Click **Buy and Start** to start the migration task.

## Stop the migration task

**Warning:** We recommend that you prepare a rollback solution to migrate incremental data from the destination database to the source database in real time. This allows you to minimize the negative impact of switching your workloads to the destination database. For more information, see [Switch workloads to the destination database](). If you do not need to switch your workloads, you can stop the migration task by using the following procedure.

-   Full data migration

    Do not manually stop a task during full data migration. Otherwise, the system may fail to migrate all data. Wait until the migration task automatically ends.

-   Incremental data migration

    The task does not automatically end during incremental data migration. You must manually stop the migration task.

    1.  Wait until the task progress bar shows **Incremental Data Migration** and **The migration task is not delayed**. Then, stop writing data to the source database for a few minutes. In some cases, the progress bar shows the delay time of **incremental data migration**.
    2.  After the status of **incremental data migration** changes to **The migration task is not delayed**, manually stop the migration task.

        ![Stop a task during incremental migration](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/2940359951/p47604.png)


## What to do next

The database accounts used for data migration have the read/write permissions. After data is migrated, you must delete the database accounts to ensure security.
