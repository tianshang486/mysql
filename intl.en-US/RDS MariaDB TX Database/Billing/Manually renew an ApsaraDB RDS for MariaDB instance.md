# Manually renew an ApsaraDB RDS for MariaDB instance

This topic describes how to manually renew an ApsaraDB RDS for MariaDB instance that uses the subscription billing method. We recommend that you manually renew your RDS instance before the expiration date. This allows you to prevent service interruptions and data losses.

For more information about the impacts that are caused by subscription expiration, see [Unlock or rebuild an expired or overdue ApsaraDB RDS instance](/intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Unlock or rebuild an expired or overdue ApsaraDB RDS instance.md).

**Note:** RDS instances that use the pay-as-you-go billing method do not expire and therefore do not require renewal.

You can manually renew your RDS instance before it expires or within 15 days after it expires.

## Method 1: Renew an RDS instance in the ApsaraDB RDS console

1.  Log on to the [ApsaraDB RDS console](https://rds.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select the region where the RDS instance resides.

3.  Find the RDS instance and in the Actions column click **Renew**.
4.  On the Renew Subscription page, specify the Duration parameter. A longer subscription period indicates more discounts.

## Enable auto-renewal for an RDS instance

After auto-renewal is enabled for an RDS instance, you do not need to renew the RDS instance on a regular basis. This allows you to prevent service interruptions that are caused by subscription expiration. For more information, see [Enable auto-renewal for an ApsaraDB RDS for MariaDB TX instance](/intl.en-US/RDS MariaDB TX Database/Billing/Enable auto-renewal for an ApsaraDB RDS for MariaDB TX instance.md).
