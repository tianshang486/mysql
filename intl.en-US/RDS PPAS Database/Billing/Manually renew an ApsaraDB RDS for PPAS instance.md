# Manually renew an ApsaraDB RDS for PPAS instance

This topic describes how to manually renew an ApsaraDB RDS for PPAS instance. If your RDS instance uses subscription billing, you must renew it before it expires. This allows you to prevent service interruptions and data loss.

For more information about the impacts caused by subscription expiration, see [Unlock or rebuild an expired or overdue ApsaraDB for RDS instance](/intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Unlock or rebuild an expired or overdue ApsaraDB for RDS instance.md).

**Note:** RDS instances that use the pay-as-you-go billing method do not expire and therefore do not require renewal.

You can manually renew your RDS instance before it expires or within 15 days after it expires.

## Method 1: Renew an RDS instance in the ApsaraDB RDS console

1.  Log on to the [ApsaraDB RDS console](https://rds.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  In the upper-left corner of the page, select the region where the RDS instance resides.

3.  Find the RDS instance and in the Actions column click **Renew**.
4.  On the Renew Subscription page, specify the Duration parameter. A longer subscription period indicates more discounts.

## Enable auto-renewal

If you enable auto-renewal for your RDS instance, you do not need to manually renew your RDS instance. If your Alibaba Cloud account has a sufficient balance, your RDS instance never expires.
